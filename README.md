# CS400 (Programming III) Projects

These are all of the projects that were assigned to me during the time I was taking this course. I didn't think far enough ahead to save the prompts for these projects, so the  section under each project is just my best guess of what the project was trying to teach us.

For this course, we were divided into groups of 8 and then into two groups of 4, with each person having a role of either Frontend, Backend, Algorithm Engineer, or Data Wrangler. The course had three medium-sized projects through the year, where the four of us needed to collaborate and integrate our code with everyone else's. The first project brief was assigned, the second and third we were given a restriction (had to utilize a certain data type), but were allowed to be creative otherwise.

For each project, every student in the class needed to submit an implementation of a certain data type in Java, which is why I have directories with \_solo appended to them - these are my submissions. The directories without \_solo are the full projects.

I tried my best to erase any personal information of those in my group for these projects, but it's totally possible that I missed something. Just shoot me an email at max.r.rountree@gmail.com or open an issue or pull request and I'll delete whatever needs to be deleted.

## Project 1: Hashtable

- Introduction to hash tables and how they work
- Required us to build our own hash table and identify solutions for conflicts (chaining was used in this example)
- Full group project was a show information retrieval tool, that very quickly pulls lots of stats from a large list of shows (using a HashtableMap)

## Project 2: Red-Black Tree

- Introduction to red-black trees and how they work
- Required us to build our own red-black tree and handle insertions, deletions, and all of those funky edge cases
- Full group project was an information search tool for COVID cases in nearby counties (this was when the pandemic was still ongoing), and allowed the user to search by ranges (of covid cases)

## Project 3: Dijkstra's

- Introduction to shortest paths and Dijkstra's algorithm
- Required us to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from one node to another in a graph
- Full group project was a tool to find flights from one city to another that covered the shortest distance (because of the project limitations, we weren't able to consider price or timing)
