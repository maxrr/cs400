# CS400 (Programming III) Projects

These projects were assigned to the group that I was a member of. Each project's description is a summary of the project from my perspective, not the prompt that was given to us.

For this course, we were divided into groups of eight and then into two groups of four, with each person taking a role of either Frontend, Backend, Algorithm Engineer, or Data Wrangler. The course had three medium-sized projects through the year, where the four of us needed to collaborate and integrate our code with everyone else's. The first project brief was assigned, the second and third we were given a restriction (i.e. had to utilize a certain data type), but were allowed to be creative otherwise.

For each project, every student in the class needed to submit an implementation of a certain data type or structure, which is why these directories with \_solo appended to them - these are my individual submissions. Unfortunately, I am unable to upload the full submission here due to class restrictions and concerns about plagiarism.

## Project 1: Hashtable

- Introduction to hash tables and how they work
- Required us to build our own hash table and identify solutions for conflicts (chaining was used in this example)
- Full group project was a show information retrieval tool, that very quickly pulls lots of stats from a large list of shows (using a HashtableMap)

## Project 2: Red-Black Tree

- Introduction to red-black trees and how they work
- Required us to build our own red-black tree and handle insertions, deletions, and all of those funky edge cases
- Full group project was an information search tool for COVID cases in nearby counties (this was when the pandemic was still ongoing), and allowed the user to search by ranges (of covid cases)

## Project 3: Dijkstra's

- Introduction to shortest paths and Dijkstra's algorithm
- Required us to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from one node to another in a graph
- Full group project was a tool to find flights from one city to another that covered the shortest distance (because of the project limitations, we weren't able to consider price or timing)
